# Airline_Reservation_System
The project aims at developing an online application of airline reservation system that helps the user to book the flight tickets online without visiting the booking counters.The system allows the airline passenger to search for flights that are available between the two travel cities, namely the “Departure city” and “Arrival city” for a particular departure and arrival dates. The system displays all the flight’s details such as flight no, name, price and duration of journey etc.
